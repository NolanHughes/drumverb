1. Cart
		-Display the number of products on button
		-Have this post to api (Maybe add users so the functionality is better, but not necessary)
		-Minimal styling
		-Make buy button that deletes the cart
		-Make alerts when products are added to cart
		-Dont have multiple instances of same product. Set quantities and render a number besides if added multiple times.
3. Implement categories/tags/more properties on rails side so querying, filtering, and sorting can be implemented like the real website.
		-Have sidebar and dropdowns for filtering/sorting
4. Get search button to work in SearchedProducts
5. Finish styling it just like reverb
