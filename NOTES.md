1. Cart
	-Have this post to api (Add users so the functionality works)(ignore this) 
	-Make alerts when products are added to cart (style phase) 
	-Dont have multiple instances of same product. Set it so in same session you can't add same product twice. Create an “error” or real error message saying you can't do that and disallow users from actually adding it again.

2. Set up querying and filtering that can be implemented like the real website.
	-Have sidebar and filtered_by for filtering

3. Implement real image upload

4. Get search button to work better in SearchedProducts after adjusting for categories, brand, model, etc.

5. Finish styling it just like reverb
