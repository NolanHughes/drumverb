1. Cart
	-Have this post to api (Maybe add users so the functionality is better, but not necessary)
	-Make alerts when products are added to cart
	-Dont have multiple instances of same product. Set quantities and render a number besides if added multiple times.

2. Implement categories/tags/more properties on rails side so querying, filtering, and sorting can be implemented like the real website.
	-Have sidebar and dropdowns for filtering/sorting

3. Get search button to work better in SearchedProducts after adjusting for categories, tags, etc.

4. Finish styling it just like reverb
