1. Cart
	-Have this post to api (Add users so the functionality works)(ignore this) 
	-Make alert when products are added to cart
		-Done except it needs to be refactored and maybe have background color overlay

2. Set up querying and filtering that can be implemented like the real website.
	-Have sidebar and filtered_by for filtering

3. Implement real image upload

4. Finish styling it just like reverb

5. Check to see if you can make components stateless at end

6. Maybe fix navbar changing size? when the intro component is present vs not.
