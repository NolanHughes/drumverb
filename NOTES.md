0. Modify SellProduct to update redux state instead of react

1. Finish styling it just like reverb
	-Adjust thumbnail size and styling in product_image model so it is completely right no matter the upload dimensions

2. Check to see if you can make components stateless at end
	-Refactor SellProduct.js	

3. Adjust origins and resources in config/application.rb (screenshot)

4. Refactor everything


5. Could make searching go into category array?
5.1 Could make default filtered_by be drums and percussion || tail end of url?
5.2 Could make searchbar not allow you to search with nothing entered

6. Cart
	-Have this post to api (Add users so the functionality works)(ignore this) 
	-Maybe have background color overlay for pop ups

7. Maybe fix navbar changing size? when the intro component is present vs not.

8. Add Edit component?
