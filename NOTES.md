1. Refactor SellProduct.js to separate display component and maybe put in containers

5. Make searching go into category array

6. Make default filtered_by be drums and percussion || tail end of url depending on url (now it's always defaulted to drums and percussion)

7.* Could make searchbar not allow you to search with nothing entered

8. Have cart this post to api (Have to add users to this)

9. Add Edit component

10. Styling
	-require upload width of 620px
	-Have dropdown searchbar have a default list
	-Have background color overlay for pop ups
	-Maybe fix navbar changing size? when the intro component is present vs not. Different screen size makes this happen so it's hard to debug.
