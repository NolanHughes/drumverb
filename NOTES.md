***Filtering by category works but now searchbar doesn't. They need to have seperate functions.***
1. Finish querying and filtering that can be implemented like the real website.
	-Have sidebar and filtered_by for filtering

2. Finish styling it just like reverb
	-Adjust thumbnail size and styling in product_image model so it is completely right no matter the upload dimensions

3. Check to see if you can make components stateless at end
	-Refactor SellProduct.js	

4. Adjust origins and resources in config/application.rb (screenshot)

	-Refactor cart add and buy pop ups and maybe have background color overlay

6. Maybe fix navbar changing size? when the intro component is present vs not.

7. Add Edit component?
